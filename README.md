Measuring-Team-Potential
========================

Python code that measures a basketball team's potential at any given point in time. First, the code scrapes NBA play-by-play data. Then it calculates several metrics to assess a team's potential. It calculates (1) the maximum point-differentials within each game, (2), the minimum point-differential within each game, and (3) several measures of the standard deviation of point differentials within each game. These metrics can then be averaged over a series of games to provide a more reliable estimate of a teams potential.
