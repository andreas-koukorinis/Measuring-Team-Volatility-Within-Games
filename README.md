Measuring-Team-Potential
========================

Measures a basketball team's potential by calculating the maximum point-differential within each game. To calculate a team's maximum point-differntial within each game, the code scrapes NBA play-by-play data. The code then extracts the maximum number of points that each team is ahead within each game. This within-game maximum can then be averaged over a series of games in order to provide a more reliable estimate of a teams potential.
